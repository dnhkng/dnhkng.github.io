I optimize systems across domains.

## Background

**Biological Systems:** CRISPR/Cas9 patents, robotics in biotech research

**Computational Systems:** Top-ranked model on HuggingFace leaderboard, novel LLM optimization methods

**Physical Systems:** Custom GH200 NVL2 server (base-modded), 400-bar espresso machine

**Coordination Systems:** Game theory for ASI-human cooperation

Currently Head of AI Product at yoummday, based in Berlin.

## What I Write About

Hard problems and how to solve them. Sometimes the problems are about aligning superintelligence with humanity. Sometimes they're about extracting better espresso. Often both require similar thinking.
